# User Guide: SCF Circle Packing Visualizer

Welcome to the **SCF Visualizer**! This guide will help you navigate the complex world of security controls using our interactive circle packing tool.

## 🧭 Navigation Basics

### 1. Zooming & Panning
- **Zoom In/Out:** Use your **mouse wheel** or trackpad scroll gesture.
- **Pan/Move:** **Click and drag** the background or any circle to move the view.
- **Focus Zoom:** **Click** on any circle to zoom directly into that category or control.
- **Reset View:** Click the background or the root "SCF 2025.4" node to reset the visualization.

### 2. Labels & Interaction
- **Hover:** Move your mouse over a circle to **enlarge** its label (28px Bold) and see its border highlight.
- **Top Labels:** Notice that group titles (like "Identify") stay at the top of their circles. This is to keep the center clear for child elements.
- **Detail Panel:** Click any **Control Circle** (the ones with IDs like IAC-01) to open a slide-out panel on the right with full details.

## 📂 Sidebar Controls

### 📦 Control Hierarchy
The hierarchy navigator lets you search or jump directly to any part of the SCF.
- Selecting a node in the tree will zoom the chart to that location.
- As you zoom in the chart, this tree will automatically update to show your current location.

### 🛡️ Compliance Regimes
Choose which frameworks you want to visualize.
- **Search:** Type in the box to find frameworks like "ISO", "GDPR", or "SOC2".
- **Color Coding:** Each selected regime is assigned a unique color, shown in the **Legend** at the bottom right.
- **Persistence:** The tool remembers your selections even after you refresh the page.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Unmapped Controls:** The sidebar has a toggle to **"Show Unmapped"**. Turn this OFF to see only the controls that are relevant to your selected regimes.
- **Breadcrumbs:** Use the breadcrumb path at the top left to track exactly where you are in the 6-level hierarchy.
- **Click Outside:** You can close the Detail Panel by clicking anywhere on the background.
